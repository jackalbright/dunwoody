<h3 >Board of Trustees</h3>
    <p class=''>Dunwoody Village is overseen by a board of trustees made up of voting members including residents and emeritus trustees, as well as local professionals in the areas of finance, healthcare and construction, all serving in a volunteer capacity. The president of the Residents’ Association is an ex-officio member of the board with voting privileges. The board meets monthly except during the summer, to review finances, strategic planning and to provide general oversight of Dunwoody Village.

    <h3 >Residents' Association</h3>
    <p>Upon entry to Dunwoody Village, every resident automatically becomes a member of the Residents' Association. An independent, self-governing body, the Residents' Association holds monthly meetings, except during the summer. It gives collective voice to the needs and desires of Dunwoody Village residents, and through its numerous committees and initiatives, Association volunteers help organize activities to further enhance life at Dunwoody. Officers and the Association's Executive Committee are elected annually. 
    </p>
    <h3 >Internal Leadership Team</h3>
    <p>Our internal Leadership Team meets once a month to review priorities for upholding the quality of the Dunwoody experience. Members of the team report to the president/CEO and are responsible for the day-to-day running of Dunwoody Village. In addition, the Dunwoody Leadership Team holds quarterly town meetings with the residents to present current information and future plans of interest. The team includes the president/CEO, the executive director, health services director, facilities and security director, human resources director, director of nursing, housekeeping director, dining services director, controller and marketing/admissions director.
