<h3>Body, Mind, and Spirit</h3>

<p class='bigFirst'>Dunwoody Village is known for its five-star rated healthcare, and it begins with wellness. The following are just some of the ways we encourage residents feeling and living well.</p>
<h3>Mind</h3>
<p>At Dunwoody, we take intellectual engagement seriously. Educational lectures, foreign language labs and conversations, historical events and monthly enrichment activities help keep residentsâ€™ minds active, while book reviews and discussions are lively exchanges for opinions and ideas.
</p>
<h3>Body</h3>
<p>Residents' physical wellbeing is our top priority, and our healthcare is second to none. A 5-star rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, our award-winning rehabilitation and nursing staff, and an agency-free approach to staffing means that Dunwoody ensures consistent, personalized healthcare from experts our residents know and trust. Continuing care means that we are here to support you, ready to adapt should your needs change over time. Through our Passport to Wellness program, all residents are given a health maintenance profile so that residents can travel through the Village with a centralized record of appointments, diagnostics and follow-up information. Fitness offerings, from gym workouts to Tai Chi and pilates classes and healthy dining options are another important part of our whole body approach to feeling great.
</p>
<h3>Spirit</h3>
<p>Critical to feeling well is living fully. Religious services onsite encourage spiritual growth. Support groups for caregivers foster emotional connection. Volunteer opportunities, some of them intergenerational, are enriching for the soul. Our ample green space allows room for both daily movement and meditation, and since wellness also encompasses the home, Dunwoody has developed green initiatives to keep the environment clean and eco-friendly. And with our pet-friendly policies, animal companions thrive here.
