<h1>Convenience</h1>
<p class='bigFirst'>
Location is everything, and Dunwoody Village is conveniently close to all that Newtown Square has to offer.  
</p>
<p>
A paved pathway connects residents to walkable shopping, including a grocery store, drug store, card store, dry cleaners, liquor store and beer distributor, hardware store, banks, and several restaurants. More restaurants and shopping are a short drive away.
</p>
<p>
Ideally located near Route 3 and the Blue Route (I-476), Dunwoody Village gives residents easy access to Center City Philadelphia and all of the attractions of the Main Line. The immediate area is well-lit and amenable for nighttime driving. The Bryn Mawr train station is just a few miles away. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to the many modern conveniences close at hand, Dunwoody residents also enjoy the relaxing comfort and quiet of the Villageâ€™s 83-acre campus, replete with a walking trail. Our park-like surroundings make Dunwoody living convenient for animal companions as well.
