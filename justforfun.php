<h1>Just For Fun</h1>
<p class='bigFirst'>With a rich array of daily programs to keep you busy, there's never a dull moment at Dunwoody Village. On a given day there might be a jazz trio, a guest speaker, a trip to a local museum, a Tai Chi class or a French language immersion dinner-there's truly something for every interest and Dunwoody residents enjoy rich and active lives.
</p>
<p>Events on the property are easily accessed through covered heated walkways, while shuttle transportation is provided for offsite activities, including shopping, religious worship and excursions. Dunwoody Village is also conveniently located near the commuter train to Center City Philadelphia.
