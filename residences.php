<h1>Residences</h1>
<p class='bigFirst'>
Dunwoody Village understands that you are an individual, with individual tastes, and that’s why we offer our residents the ability to customize their living spaces. Whether you opt for a studio, a junior one-bedroom, a one- or two-bedroom apartment, or a more expansive country house, you will find there’s a home to suit your needs and tastes. Our residences offer roomy closets, individual temperature controls, and lovely terrace views. Fully enclosed walkways from all residences to the Community Building make it easy to get out of the house, even when the weather is uncooperative.
