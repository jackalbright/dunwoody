      </blockquote>
      <h3>APPLICATION OF THIS NOTICE</h3>
      <p>In most cases, this Notice will be provided to the resident.  Accordingly, throughout this Notice we use the terms &ldquo;you&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; primarily with reference to the resident. In some cases, however, a resident representative such as a guardian, agent under a power of attorney for healthcare, or conservator, will represent the resident. In those situations in which the resident is unable or unwilling to exercise certain resident rights regarding the control of medical information, &ldquo;you&rdquo; may pertain to the resident representative. </p>
      <p>This notice applies to information and records regarding your health care maintained at Dunwoody Village, including medical records and payment information (medical information).</p>
      <h3>WHO WILL FOLLOW THIS NOTICE</h3>
      <p>This notice describes our practices and that of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any health care professional authorized to enter information into your chart.</li>
        <li>Any member of a volunteer group we allow to help you.</li>
        <li>All employees, staff and other personnel.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>OUR PLEDGE REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION</h3>
      <p>We understand that medical information about you and your health is personal. We are committed to protecting medical information about you. We create a record of the care and services you receive.  We need this record to provide you with quality care and to comply with certain legal requirements. This notice applies to all of the records of your care, whether made by personnel or your personal doctor. Your personal doctor may have different policies or notices regarding the doctor's use and disclosure of your medical information created in the doctor's office or clinic.</p>
      <p>This notice will tell you about the ways in which we may use and disclose medical information about you. We also describe your rights and certain obligations we have regarding the use and disclosure of medical information.</p>
      <p>We are required by law to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>make sure that medical information that identifies you is kept private;</li>
        <li>give you this notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to medical information about you; and</li>
        <li>follow the terms of the notices that are currently in effect.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>
      <p>The following categories describe different ways that we use and disclose medical information. For each category of uses or disclosures we will explain what we mean and try to give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category will be listed. However, all of the ways we are permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the categories.  All categories do fall into one of two main groupings.</p>
      <p><u><strong>1. We May Use And Disclose Your Personal Health Information For Treatment, Payment, And Health Care Operations Without Needing To Obtain Your Consent</strong></u></p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><strong>For Treatment.</strong></u>  We may use medical information about you to provide you with medical treatment or services. We may disclose medical information about you to doctors, nurses, technicians, students, or other personnel who are involved in taking care of you. For example, a doctor treating you for a broken hip may need to know if you have diabetes because diabetes may slow the healing process. In addition, the doctor may need to tell the dietitian if you have diabetes so that we can arrange for appropriate meals.  Different departments may also share medical information about you in order to coordinate the different things you need, such as prescriptions, lab work and x-rays. We also may disclose medical information about you to people outside of Dunwoody Village who may be involved in your medical care after you leave, such as family members, clergy or others we use to provide services that are part of your care.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><u><strong>For Payment.</strong></u>  We may use and disclose medical information about you so that the treatment and services you receive may be billed to and payment may be collected from you, an insurance company or a third party. For example, we may need to give your health plan information so that they will pay us or reimburse you. We may also tell your health plan about a treatment you are going to receive to obtain prior approval or to determine whether your plan will cover the treatment.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><u><strong>For Health Care Operations.</strong></u>  We may use and disclose medical information about you for Dunwoody Village operations. This is to ensure that all of our residents receive quality care. For example, we may use medical information to review our treatment and services and to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you. We may also combine medical information about many residents to decide what additional services we should offer, what services are not needed, and whether certain new treatments are effective. We may also disclose information to doctors, nurses, technicians, students, and other personnel for review and learning purposes. We may also combine the medical information we have with medical information from other facilities to compare how we are doing and see where we can make improvements in the care and services we offer. We may remove information that identifies you from this set of medical information so others may use it to study health care and health care delivery without learning who the specific residents are.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><u>2.  We May Use And Disclose Personal Health Information About You For Other Specific Purposes</u></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><strong>Treatment Alternatives.</strong></u>  We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about or recommend possible treatment options or alternatives that may be of interest to you.</li>
        <li><u><strong>Health-Related Benefits and Services.</strong></u>  We may use and disclose medical information to tell you about health-related benefits or services that may be of interest to you.</li>

This information may include your name, location in the facility, and phone number. This information may also be released to persons who ask for you by name.  We may provide the directory information, including your religious affiliation, to any member of the clergy.</li>
        <li><u><strong>Individuals Involved in Your Care or Payment for Your Care.</strong></u>  We may release medical information about you to a friend or family member who is involved in your medical care. We may also give information to someone who helps pay for your care. We may also tell your family or friends your condition.  You have the right to object to this disclosure.</li>
        <li><u><strong>Disaster Relief.</strong></u>  Unless you notify us that you object, we may disclose medical information about you to an entity assisting in a disaster relief effort so that your family can be notified about your condition, status and location. </li>
        <li><u><strong>As Required By Law.</strong></u>  We will disclose medical information about you when required to do so by federal, state or local law.</li>
        <li><u><strong>To Avert a Serious Threat to Health or Safety.</strong></u>  We may use and disclose medical information about you when necessary to prevent a serious threat to your health and safety or the health and safety of the public or another person. Any disclosure, however, would only be to someone able to help prevent the threat.</li>

      <h3>YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</h3>
      <p>You have the following rights regarding medical information we maintain about you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u><strong>Right to Inspect and Copy.</strong></u>  You have the right to inspect and copy medical information that may be used to make decisions about your care. Usually, this includes medical and billing records, but does not include psychotherapy notes.<br>

            <li>Was not created by us, unless the person or entity that created the information is no longer available to make the amendment;</li>
            <li>Is not part of the medical information kept by or for Dunwoody Village;</li>
